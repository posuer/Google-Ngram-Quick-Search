# google-ngram-quick-search
A quick way to search match_count of words in Google Ngram files (1 grams). 
There is a Python Package called Google Ngram Downloader which can be used for the same purpose but it's quite slow. 
This code allows you searching the match_count quickly, which is very useful when you have to know match_count of many words.
